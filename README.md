## My Frist Website

👋Hi there, this repository is a simple website and you can see what it looks like here: [https://xitanggg.github.io/My-First-Website](https://xitanggg.github.io/My-First-Website)

![My First Website Image](https://tipstorys3bucket13315-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/protected/us-east-1%3A162fd9b5-017d-4eb8-94ff-7f301c502813/tipstory-AXDfHKdlVwPL16GcV7hXxRYYT.jpeg)

👉Anyone can learn to create this website by following the ["Code and launch your first website in 10 minutes"](https://www.tipstory.org/learning/wbkwZdT2t0pWUO5) tutorial I posted on TipStory.

---

The tutorial is beginner friendly with pictures showing each step. It is intended for high schoool students or anyone without prior coding experience.

At the end of the tutorial, students will create their own website link: [https://xitanggg.github.io/My-First-Website](https://xitanggg.github.io/My-First-Website), so they can share it with their friends and prank them with a “What’s up, my friend xxx?🤪” message on their website.

🚀Happy learning and sharing!
